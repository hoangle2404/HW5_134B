For this part, I added hover to the characteristic spans on my homepage, when users click on the span, information about me will pop up in a dialog. When the user hovers over the span, the span will rotate 360 degrees. The reason for these changes is that I want the users to understand more about me without making the homepage look messy. I also wanted to practice more about animation so I decided to implement a simple animation before spending time to implement more complex animations on my website in the future.
